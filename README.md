# Scikit-Learning-StanleyWei
 Repository for learning sklearn and testing stuff
 
 utkproject, stackoverflowproject, and moviepersonalityproject are both more-or-less done. facialemotionproject is very much not done, and I may or may not revisit it in the future.

Full faces dataset at https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/ <br>
Movie/personality dataset is somewhere on Kaggle idk
